        <p1><center>Keeping your weight in the normal range is an important part of healthy aging. <br>
            As in other stages of life, elevated body mass index (BMI) in older adults can increase the likelihood of developing health problems. <br>
            These include heart disease, high blood pressure, stroke, and diabetes. <br>
            Losing weight or maintaining a healthy weight can help decrease these risks.<br>
            Being underweight also increases your chance of developing health problems. <br>
            If you have a low BMI, you may be more likely to develop medical problems such as osteoporosis and anemia.<br>
            it may be harder to recover from an illness or infection.</p1></center><br><br>
